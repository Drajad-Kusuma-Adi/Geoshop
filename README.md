# Geoshop
My PJBL project in 10th grade in SMKN 4 Malang. An e-commerce website that emphasizes the use of map and geolocation services. Built with native PHP, JS with Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap, and Bootstrap 5.3 for the front end.
Geoshop 1.0 was the first release. Geoshop Beta was trying out, also there seems to be a bug in CRUD so don't use it without modifying it.
